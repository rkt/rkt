Before running `test-aci-auth-server` make sure that `go` and `actool` are in your
`$PATH`.

```
$ ./test-aci-auth-server start basic

{
	"rktKind": "auth",
	"rktVersion": "v1",
	"domains": ["127.0.0.1:48608"],
	"type": "basic",
	"credentials":
	{
		"user": "bar",
		"password": "baz"
	}
}

Ready, waiting for connections at https://127.0.0.1:48608
```

(You can run `test-aci-auth-server start` with either `none`, `basic` or `oauth` parameter)

Copy the snippet to `/etc/rkt/auth.d/test.json` and run `rkt
--insecure-skip-verify run
https://127.0.0.1:48608/<WHATEVER>/prog.aci`. The `rkt` output ought
to be something like:
```
# rkt --insecure-skip-verify run https://127.0.0.1:48608/basic1/prog.aci
rkt: fetching image from https://127.0.0.1:48608/basic1/prog.aci
