## Downloading Images (ACIs)

[aci-images]: https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#app-container-image
[appc-discovery]: https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#app-container-image-discovery

Rocket runs containers packaged as [Application Container Images (ACI)][aci-images] an open-source specification. ACIs consist of the root filesystem of the container, a manifest and an optional signature.

ACIs are named with a URL-like structure. This naming scheme allows for a decentralized discovery of ACIs, related signatures and public keys. Rocket uses these hints to execute [meta discovery][appc-discovery].

### rkt trust

Before executing a remotely fetched container, Rocket will verify it based on attached signatures generated by the ACI creator.

Before this can happen, Rocket needs to know which creators you trust, and therefore are trusted to run containers on your machine. The identity of each ACI creator is established with a public key, which is placed in Rocket's key store on disk.

When adding a trusted key, a prefix can scope the level of established trust to a subset of containers. A few examples:

```
$rkt trust --prefix storage.coreos.com
```

```
$rkt trust --prefix coreos.com/etcd
```

To trust a key for an entire root domain, you must use the `--root` flag.

```
$rkt trust --root coreos.com
```

#### Trust a Key Using Meta Discovery

The easiest way to trust a key is through meta discovery. Rocket will find and download a public key that the creator has published on their website. This process is detailed in the [Application Container specification][appc-discovery]. The TL;DR is Rocket will find a meta tag that looks like:

```
<meta name="ac-discovery-pubkeys" content="coreos.com/etcd https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg">
```

And use it to download the public key and present it to you for approval:

```
$ rkt trust --prefix coreos.com/etcd
Prefix: "coreos.com/etcd"
Key: "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg"
GPG key fingerprint is: 8B86 DE38 890D DB72 9186  7B02 5210 BD88 8818 2190
  CoreOS ACI Builder <release@coreos.com>
Are you sure you want to trust this key (yes/no)? yes
Trusting "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg" for prefix "coreos.com/etcd".
Added key for prefix "coreos.com/etcd" at "/etc/rkt/trustedkeys/prefix.d/coreos.com/etcd/8b86de38890ddb7291867b025210bd8888182190"
```

If Rocket can't find a key using meta discovery, an error will be printed:

```
$ rkt trust --prefix coreos.com                     
Error determining key location: --prefix meta discovery error: found no ACI meta tags
```

#### Trust a Key From Specific Location

If you know where a public key is located, you can request it directly from disk or via HTTPS:

```
$ sudo ./rkt trust --prefix coreos.com/etcd https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg
Prefix: "coreos.com/etcd"
Key: "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg"
GPG key fingerprint is: 8B86 DE38 890D DB72 9186  7B02 5210 BD88 8818 2190
  CoreOS ACI Builder <release@coreos.com>
Are you sure you want to trust this key (yes/no)? yes
Trusting "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg" for prefix "coreos.com/etcd".
Added key for prefix "coreos.com/etcd" at "/etc/rkt/trustedkeys/prefix.d/coreos.com/etcd/8b86de38890ddb7291867b025210bd8888182190"
```

#### Pre-Populating Trusted Keys on Disk

Trusted public keys can be pre-populated by placing them in the appropriate location on disk for the desired prefix.

_Depends on https://github.com/coreos/rocket/issues/500_
```
$ ls -l /etc/rkt/trustedkeys/
[insert example of root key vs prefixed key]
```

### rkt fetch

Rocket uses HTTPS to locate and download remote ACIs and their attached signatures. If the ACI exists locally, it won't be re-downloaded.

#### Fetch with Meta Discovery

The easiest way to fetch an ACI is through meta discovery. Rocket will find and download the ACI and signature from a location that the creator has published on their website. This process is detailed in the [Application Container specification][appc-discovery].

If you have previously trusted the container creator, it will be downloaded and verified: 

```
$ rkt fetch coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: searching for app image coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
Downloading aci: [=======================================      ] 3.25 MB/3.7 MB
Downloading signature from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.sig
rkt: signature verified: 
  CoreOS ACI Builder <release@coreos.com>
sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```

If you haven't trusted the creator, it will be downloaded but not verified:

```
$ sudo ./rkt fetch coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: searching for app image coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
Downloading aci: [=======================================      ] 3.25 MB/3.7 MB
Downloading signature from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.sig
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```

#### Fetch from Specific Location

If you already know where an image is stored, you can fetch it directly:

```
$ rkt fetch https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
Downloading aci: [=======================================      ] 3.25 MB/3.7 MB
Downloading signature from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.sig
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```

#### Fetch from a Docker registry

If you want to run an existing Docker image, you can fetch from a Docker registry. Rocket will download and convert the image to ACI.

```
$ rkt -insecure-skip-verify fetch docker://busybox
rkt: fetching image from docker://busybox
rkt: warning: signature verification has been disabled
Downloading layer: 4986bf8c15363d1c5d15512d5266f8777bfba4974ac56e3270e7760f6f0a8125

sha512-c4010045aec65aefa74770ef2bb648d9
```

Docker images do not support signature verification.

## Running Containers

Rocket can run ACIs based on name, hash, local file on disk or URL. If an ACI hasn't been cached on disk, Rocket will attempt to find and download it.

### rkt run

#### Image Addressing

Images can be run by either their name, their hash, an explicit transport address, or a Docker registry URL.

```
# Run by name
$ sudo rkt run coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
```

```
# Run by hash
$ sudo rkt run sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```

```
# Run by ACI address
$ sudo rkt run https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
```

```
# Run by Docker registry
$ sudo rkt run docker://quay.io/coreos/etcd:v2.0.0
```

#### Passing Arguments

To pass additional arguments to images use the pattern of `image1 -- [image1 flags] --- image2 -- [image2 flags]`.
For example:

```
$ sudo rkt run example.com/worker -- --loglevel verbose --- example.com/syncer -- --interval 30s
```

#### Influencing Environment Variables

To inherit all environment variables from the parent use the `--inherit-env` flag.

To explicitly set individual environment variables use the `--set-env` flag.

The precedence is as follows with the last item replacing previous environment entries:

- Parent environment
- App image environment
- Explicitly set environment

```
$ export EXAMPLE_ENV=hello
$ export EXAMPLE_OVERRIDE=under
$ sudo rkt run --inherit-env --set-env FOO=bar --set-env EXAMPLE_OVERRIDE=over example.com/env-printer
EXAMPLE_ENV=hello
FOO=bar
EXAMPLE_OVERRIDE=over
```

_TODO: Exit codes_
_TODO: Logging_

#### Disable Signature Verification

If desired, `-insecure-skip-verify` can be used to disable this security check:

```
$ sudo rkt -insecure-skip-verify run coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: searching for app image coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
rkt: warning: signature verification has been disabled
...
```

#### Mount Volumes into a Container

Volumes are defined in each ACI and are referenced by name. Volumes can be exposed from the host into the container (`host`) or initialized as empty storage to be accessed locally within the container (`empty` pending [rkt #378][rkt #378]). Each volume can be selectively mounted into each application at differing mount points or not mounted into specific apps at all.

[rkt #378]: https://github.com/coreos/rocket/issues/378

For `host` volumes, the `--volume` flag allows you to specify each mount, its type and the location on the host. The volume is then mounted into each app running to the container based on information defined in the ACI manifest.

For example, let's say we want to read data from the host directory `/opt/tenant1/work` to power a MapReduce-syle worker. We'll call this volume `work`. Our ACI manifest specifies that `work` is mounted read-only from the host, and is mounted at `work` and `backup` into two apps but not into the third. Here's an appreviated version of the ACI manifest: 

```
"apps": [{
  "app": "example.com/reduce-worker-1.0.0",
  "mounts": [
       {"volume": "work", "mountPoint": "work"}
  ]
  ...
},
{
  "app": "example.com/worker-backup-1.0.0",
  "mounts": [
       {"volume": "work", "mountPoint": "backup"}
  ]
  ...
},
{
  "app": "example.com/reduce-worker-register-1.0.0",
  ...
}],
"volumes": [
  {
    "name": "work",
    "kind": "host",
    "source": "/opt/tenant1/work",
    "readOnly": true
  }
],
...
```

The corresponding `rkt run` looks like:

```
sudo ./rkt run --volume work,kind=host,source=/opt/tenant1/work \
  example.com/reduce-worker-1.0.0 \
  example.com/worker-backup-1.0.0 \
  example.com/reduce-worker-register-1.0.0
```

#### Customize Networking

The default networking configuration for Rocket is "host networking". This means that the apps within the pod will share the network stack and the interfaces with the host machine. Since the metadata service uses the container IP for identity, rkt will not register the container with the metadata service in this mode.

##### Private Networking

Another common configuration, "private networking", means the pod will be executed with its own network stack. This is similar to how other container tools work. The [metadata service](metadata-service.md) (launched via `rkt metadata-service`) must be running to use private networking.

By default, Rocket private networking will create a loopback device and a veth device. The veth pair creates a point-to-point link between the container and the host. Rocket will allocate an IPv4 /31 (2 IP addresses) out of 172.16.28.0/24 and assign one IP to each end of the veth pair. It will additionally set a route for metadata service (169.254.169.255/32) and default route in the container namespace. Finally, it will enable IP masquerading on the host to NAT the egress traffic.

```
sudo ./rkt run --private-net coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
```

Additional networking modes and more examples can be found in the [networking documentation](networking.md)

## Other Commands

### rkt gc

Rocket has a built-in garbage collection command that is designed to be run periodically from a timer or cron job. Stopped containers are moved to the garbage and cleaned up during a subsequent garbage collection pass. Each `gc` pass removes any containers remaining in the garbage past the grace period. [Read more about the container lifecycle][gc-docs].

[gc-docs]: container-lifecycle.md#garbage-collection

```
$ rkt gc --grace-period=30m0s
Moving container "21b1cb32-c156-4d26-82ae-eda1ab60f595" to garbage
Moving container "5dd42e9c-7413-49a9-9113-c2a8327d08ab" to garbage
Moving container "f07a4070-79a9-4db0-ae65-a090c9c393a3" to garbage
```

On the next pass, the containers are removed:

```
$ rkt gc --grace-period=30m0s
Garbage collecting container "21b1cb32-c156-4d26-82ae-eda1ab60f595"
Garbage collecting container "5dd42e9c-7413-49a9-9113-c2a8327d08ab"
Garbage collecting container "f07a4070-79a9-4db0-ae65-a090c9c393a3"
```
