# Running rkt with an LKVM stage1

rkt has experimental support for running with an [LKVM](https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/will/kvmtool/+/master/README) stage1.
That is, rkt will start a virtual machine with full hypervisor isolation instead of creating a container using Linux cgroups and namespaces.

## Getting started

You can either use `stage1-lkvm.aci` from the official release, or build rkt yourself with the right options:

```
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --with-stage1=kvm && make
```

This will build the rkt binary and the LKVM stage1.aci in `build-rkt-0.8.0-rc1/bin/`.

Provided you have hardware virtualization support and the [kernel KVM module](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Getting_the_kvm_kernel_modules) loaded (refer to your distribution for instructions), you can then run an image like you would normally do with rkt:

```

This output is the same you'll get if you run a container-based rkt.
If you want to see the kernel and boot messages, run rkt with the `--debug` flag.

You can exit pressing `<Ctrl-a x>`.

### Selecting stage1 at runtime

If you want to run software that requires hypervisor isolation along with trusted software that only needs container isolation, you can [choose which stage1.aci to use at runtime](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/blob/master/Documentation/commands.md#use-a-custom-stage-1).

For example, if you have a container stage1 named `stage1.aci` and a lkvm stage1 named `stage1-lkvm.aci` in `/usr/local/rkt/`:

```
# rkt run --stage1-image=/usr/local/rkt/stage1.aci coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.9
...
# rkt run --stage1-image=/usr/local/rkt/stage1-lkvm.aci coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.9
...
```

## How does it work?

It leverages the work done by Intel with their [Clear Containers system](https://lwn.net/Articles/644675/).
Stage1 contains a Linux kernel that is executed under LKVM.
This kernel will then start systemd, which in turn will start the applications in the pod.

A LKVM-based rkt is very similar to a container-based one, it just uses lkvm to execute pods instead of systemd-nspawn.

Here's a comparison of the components involved between a container-based and a LKVM based rkt.

Container-based:

```
host OS
  └─ rkt
    └─ systemd-nspawn
      └─ systemd
        └─ chroot
          └─ user-app1
```


LKVM based:

```
host OS
  └─ rkt
    └─ lkvm
      └─ kernel
        └─ systemd
          └─ chroot
            └─ user-app1
```
