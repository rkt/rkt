# rkt roadmap

This document defines a high level roadmap for rkt development.
The dates below should not be considered authoritative, but rather indicative of the projected timeline of the project.
The [milestones defined in GitHub](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/milestones) represent the most up-to-date state of affairs.

rkt is an implementation of the [App Container spec](https://github.com/appc/spec), which is still under active development on an approximately similar timeframe.
The version of the spec that rkt implements can be seen in the output of `rkt version`.

rkt's version 1.0 release marks the command line user interface and on-disk data structures as stable and reliable for external development. The (optional) API for pod inspection is not yet completely stabilized, but is quite usable.

## Ongoing projects

- [CRI](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/projects/1): implementation of the new Container Runtime Interface from Kubernetes.
